👋 Hello, I'm Henry
Community architect, social media strategist & relentless UX tester with a sharp eye for digital behavior.

🧠 About Me
💼 Job: I work at the intersection of strategy, community, and user experience. As a community manager, I cultivate spaces where people feel seen, heard, and engaged. As a social media lead, I create content that not only performs, it connects. And as a tester, I dive into platforms before the public does, catching the cracks before they spread.

⚙️ Projects:

Developed onboarding and engagement strategies for niche digital communities

Designed and executed social media plans that grew organic reach by 200%

Led usability testing sprints for apps still in stealth, finding issues before users ever noticed

Constantly analyzing trends, user behavior, and emotional triggers in digital spaces

💬 Languages: Portuguese (native), English (fluent — both casual & professional contexts)
💻 OS: Windows for daily work, Linux for exploration, and a controller nearby in case the day ends early 😅
🔧 Tools: Notion, Trello, Figma, Meta Suite, Hootsuite, Google Analytics, ChatGPT, and a dangerously fast Alt+Tab reflex
